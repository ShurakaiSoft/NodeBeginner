# NodeSandbox

## Objective
This code was written while reading the book "The Node Beginner Book" by 
Manual Kiessling, and working through the application example it described.


## Usage
It's a node application so use start node with:

`node index.js` 


## Developing
I have completed the book and tutorial code. There may well still be bugs in
this code but return on investment is means it's not actively being worked on.
